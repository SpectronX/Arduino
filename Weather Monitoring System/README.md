## What's being built?

This was a group project, as part of my coursework, for a period of time within a semester. The goal was to build a simple weather monitoring system that takes readings of the relative humidity of the atmosphere, the temperature of the surroundings, and the atmospheric pressure. These readings were then displayed on an LCD. With this opportunity, I had the chance to work with real devices after playing around with simulations for some time. At some point, one has to realize some challenges that, probably, working with computer simulations might abstract or work out for you. Yes, I had such moments. Nevertheless, it all counted in the learning process.
