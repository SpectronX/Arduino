## What's being built?

--

This was a group project, as part of the coursework for a period of time within a semester. The goal was to build a simple weather monitoring system that takes readings of the relative humidity of the atmosphere, the temperature of the surroundings, and the atmospheric pressure. These readings were then displayed on an LCD.
