# Arduino-Based Home Automation Systems

As part of exploring the capabilities of Arduino, I developed a series of subsystems to simulate simple home automation functionalities. These projects focused on practical and beginner-friendly implementations, covering four key systems:

- Intruder Detection System  
- Automatic Lighting System  
- Temperature-Controlled Fan System  
- Automatic Door System

## Intruder Detection System

This system uses a **PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor** and a **buzzer**. When motion is detected in a monitored or restricted area, the buzzer sounds, alerting the user. This setup can be used for home security or for detecting presence in a space.
