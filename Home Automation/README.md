## Using Arduino to Automate stuff in the house.

Still exploring Arduino's functionalities and capabilities, I tried to automate some activities using Arduino and other sensors. 

## Systems used in this project.

The first setup was an Intruder Detection System. By employing the PIR Sensor and buzzer, I set up a system that notifies the house owner, when movements is detected in prohibited spaces. In terms of security, this plays major role and is much more effective when scaled.
