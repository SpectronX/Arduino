# Arduino-Based Home Automation Systems

As part of exploring what Arduino can be used for, I worked on a series of subsystems to simulate simple home automation functionalities. With practical beginner-friendly implementations, I managed to cover four key systems:

- Intruder Detection System
- Automatic Door System
- Temperature-Controlled Fan System
- Automatic Lighting System

## Intruder Detection System

This system uses a **PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor** and a **buzzer** (would be adding a LCD display to it soon). Simple function: when motion is detected in a monitored or restricted area, the buzzer sounds, alerting the user. This setup can be used for home security or for detecting presence in a space.
